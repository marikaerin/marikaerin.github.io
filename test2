I seek to understand the universe.

Currently, I attend the University of Florida pursuing a PhD in Astronomy. I’m interested in Cosmology (The Structure of the Universe), Massive Compact Objects (Black Holes), and Instrumentation and Engineering (Mechanical, Electrical, Computational, Solar, and Astronautical). Basically….everything.

When I’m not gazing at the stars, my interests lie in social, economic, political, educational, mental and emotional health, and equality for all.

I am passionate about family, music, art, and the history and future of science.
